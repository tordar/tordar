### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welome to my GitHub profile! Here you will find some of the projects I have worked on in the past year, as I'm on the journey to becoming a completely self-taught developer. This is something I take great pride in, but always includes the humility to learn from people with more experience than me.


ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning any way to become a better developer. Lately that has been different ways of deployment, and developing my React skills.

âš¡ I love to work on anything that has to do with web development. Creating cool solutions, web apps, primarily working on front-end, but always keen to work on anything that has to do with the back-end.

ðŸ“« You can reach me the easiest via [e-mail](emailto:tordar.tommervik@gmail.com), or via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tordar/)
