### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welome to my GitHub profile! Here you will find some of the projects I have worked on in the process of going from a social science major, to self-taught developer. This is something I take great pride in, but always with the humility to learn from people with more experience than me.


ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working as a developer, for [Umain](https://www.umain.com/), while also, building out some smaller hobby projects in my free time.

âš¡ I love to work on anything that has to do with web development. Creating cool solutions, web apps, primarily working on front-end, but always keen to work on anything that has to do with the back-end.

ðŸ“« You can reach me the easiest via [e-mail](mailto:tordar.tommervik@gmail.com), or via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tordar/)
